<br> <!-- only way to get bigger gap? -->

## Almost 0 Profit

Almost 0 Profit is an iniciative where all items purchased are run through a 'tab'.

This tab is a 2-cent-to-the-dollar tax applied to everything on Amazins. Every 100 USD spent on our store is equal to 2 USD for maintenance and continued production of our platform.
This is also equal to a 0.02% tax, if you prefer percentages and taxes.

We **PUBLICLY** share data about our profits for transparency.

All of our *free-offers* and *flash-deals* include our Almost 0 Profit tab. Yes, for free items you will pay at least 0,02USD.

## Third-Parties and Collected Data

We **DO NOT** collect any personal data that is useless to us, and only store what is absolutely neccessary during a transaction.

We use **THIRD-PARTIES** to collect, exchange and refund any monetary purchases.

The list of 3rd Parties is as follows:
- Stripe (stripe.com) - Takes care of all our monetary charges.
- Firebase (firebase.google.com) - Takes care of order fullfillments.
- PerkUp (perkupapp.com) - Manages the Staff Payments.
