# Almost 0 Profit

Almost 0 Profit is an iniciative where all items purchased are run through a 'tab'.

This tab is a 2-cent-to-the-dollar tax applied to everything on Amazins. Every 100 USD spent on our store is equal to 2 USD for maintenance and continued production of our platform.
This is also equal to a 0.02% tax, if you prefer percentages and taxes.

We **PUBLICLY** share data about our profits for transparency.

All of our *free-offers* and *flash-deals* include our Almost 0 Profit tab. Yes, for free items you will pay at least 0,02USD.

## Third-Parties and Collected Data

We **DO NOT** collect any personal data that is useless to us, and only store what is absolutely neccessary during a transaction.

We use **THIRD-PARTIES** to collect, exchange and refund any monetary purchases.

The list of 3rd Parties is as follows:
- Stripe (stripe.com) - Takes care of all our monetary charges.
- Firebase (firebase.google.com) - Takes care of order fullfillments.
- PerkUp (perkupapp.com) - Manages the Staff Payments.


# Staff

## Staff Payments

As mentioned above, our Staff are paid. Those payments are organised and sent via PerkUp to the Staff.

PerkUp sends this money in the form of pre-paid top-up credit cards called 'Perk Cards'. Find out more on [their website](https://perkupapp.com)

## Products and Pricing

All of our products are either 3D Printed at our warehouse or bought over from a third party. Third party buys are indicated throughout the purchase process.

### Printups

Mock Images, or "Printups" are made using either CAD software, 3D modelling software, or pre-designed clothes with green slots for logo's.
Images taken by our staff are of either themselves or by another staff member they trust to take the picture.

The member of staff in the picture is the only one who sends the final image in for public display, with no trace of their face. If faces are visible, Printups are rejected.

# Organisation Collaborators

Our collaborators are trusted members who we allow to modify our source code for specific public/private repositories on our GitHub or Codeberg.

Collaborators on GitHub or Codeberg are Volunteers that try to make the End User Experience the best they can. Volunteers are not paid as Staff, although larger donations have been known to be shared across our Volunteer and Staff Teams.
